      About Tim

      <p1>
        Through working in the fitness industry for the past 8 years, I found a
        passion for helping people change their lives through health & wellness.
        As the Club Manager, I was responsible for overseeing 25+ employees. As
        the Regional Training Manager, I was also responsible for training newly
        hired & promoted Managers, as well as the career development of
        Assistant Managers. As a leader, I strived to create an environment
        where people could be themselves & grow, while enjoying their time at
        work.

        Despite also being a sports fan, I've always been a nerd at heart. My
        love of video games & technology motivated me to take the leap to change
        fields. Learning how to code has already been a rewarding journey that's
        challenged me to think more strategically, analytically & creatively.
        Becoming a Full Stack Developer is my dream that I work hard everyday to
        make reality.
